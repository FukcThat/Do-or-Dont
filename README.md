# Do-or-Dont

Odin Project Todo List - Attempt No. 2

Use date-fns for date formatting and such

- Make To-Do class
- Make Project Class to house the Todos
- Consider default / "Home Collection"
- Keep application logic separate from DOM stuff (so modules and such)
- User Interface required functionality
  -> View all collections
  -> View all (shrunk down) todos in each collection
  -> Expand Todo to see & edit details
  -> Delete a todo
- Implement local storage
